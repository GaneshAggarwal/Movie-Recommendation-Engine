# Movie-Recommendation-Engine
This project mainly aims at providing movie recommendations which are similar to a given movie/show as input. Seven of the top similar movies/shows are recommended. Four basic python libraries (networkx,pandas,matplotlib and sklearn) and concepts like adamic adar measures and k-means clustering have been used to find the best possible recommendations for a given query. Similarity is found on the basis of genre, actors, directors, country and the description of the movies/shows.
